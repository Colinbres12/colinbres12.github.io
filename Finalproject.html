<h2 class="white centered" id="about"> About the Bruins</h2>
<p1 class="white">The Boston Bruins are a professional ice hockey team based in Boston. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team has been in existence since 1924, and is the league's third-oldest team overall and the oldest in the United States. It is also an Original Six franchise, along with the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs. The Bruins have won six Stanley Cup championships, tied for fourth most of all-time with the Blackhawks and tied second-most of any American NHL team also with the Blackhawks (behind the Red Wings, who have 11).

The first facility to host the Bruins was the Boston Arena (today's Matthews Arena) – the world's oldest (built 1909–10) indoor ice hockey facility still in use for the sport at any level of competition[3][4] – and following the Bruins' departure from the Boston Arena, the team played its home games at the Boston Garden for 67 seasons, beginning in 1928 and concluding in 1995, when they moved to the TD Garden.</p1>
        

        
        
<h2 class="centered white" id="season"> Season</h2>
<p1 class=" white"> The Bruins are currently in 2nd in the Atlantic Division.  Last night, 4-26-18 they deafeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in a 4-3 victory in game 7. They will move on to round two the playoff and with face the Tampa Bay Lightining. Critics say that they like the Bruins chances of winning the cup this year. Here is what critics say about the team,"And so when the Bruins finally, finally, finally finished off the Toronto Maple Leafs last night at the Garden, roaring back with four third-period goals and claiming a 7-4 Game 7 victory, Bruins fans weren’t just cheering. Turn up the Garden volume a bit and you could hear sighs of relief. Many of ’em.

The Bruins wiped the Leafs off the Garden ice in Games 1 and 2. And then everything changed, as the Leafs came back to tie the series. Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask, often in the crosshairs of the hometown mob, was pulled from a game. Yesterday, Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy’s decision not to dress Harvard boy Ryan Donato for Game 7 led to an entire day of point/counterpoint anywhere in Greater Boston where hockey is the talk.

For now, everyone can calm down. The Bruins live. Their next foe is the Tampa Bay Lightning, which means another chance to see the B’s exciting cast of early-twentysomethings under the bright lights of the Stanley Cup tourney.

“We’re not here without the core group,” said Cassidy, “but we’ve supplemented them with some good young players.”

To put things in perspective, consider the resumes of the Maple Leafs’ Patrick Marleau and last night’s Bruins’ hero, Jake DeBrusk. Each player scored two goals last night. That’s where the comparisons end. Marleau is 38; De Brusk is 21. When Marleau played his first NHL game, on Oct.1, 1997 for the San Jose Sharks, DeBrusk was just over a year old.

To pick another Bruin, Charlie McAvoy, he wasn’t even born when Marleau played his first game. (On the day McAvoy was born, on Dec. 21, 1997, Marleau was playing for the Sharks that night in Anaheim. That’s nuts.)

But you get the point . . . these are not your father’s Bruins. These aren’t even your big brother’s Bruins. These are the Millennial B’s, and winger Jake DeBrusk is making noise about being the next Boston sports hotshot.

On a night when some of the veterans failed and

or flailed — there was a two-for-the-price-of-one Bruins A’struggling when Brad Marchand was taken down as Kasperi Kapanen moved in on Rask and badly deked the goaltender for a shorthanded goal — it was the kiddos who gave you hope for the future.

Except that we’re now talking the near-future, not some far away future.

DeBrusk’s second goal, the one that gave the B’s a 5-4 lead and effectively snuffed out the Maple Leafs, was as vivid an example of the March of Youth as you’ll ever see. It might have looked like nothing more than pure speed and hustle at first glance, given the way the kid rocketed up the ice to the left of Toronto goaltender Frederik Andersen, but the way he moved the puck to his forehand at the end and then sent it into the net had nothing to do with youth. That was raw talent.

“And he scored going to the dirty area,” said Cassidy of DeBrusk. “Those weren’t freebies . . . real greasy . . . I was happy for him.”

But while a kid named DeBrusk made everyone happy, a veteran named Rask sent everyone home with nagging worries. For Rask was the fine point to last night’s big win:

Tuukka gave up four goals.

Everyone’s going out of their minds about Rask. Everyone. WEEI’s Lou Merloni made an appearance on a Toronto radio station the other day and expressed some concern about Rask going into Game 7, after which NESN play-by-play man Jack Edwards later appeared on the same Toronto station and dismissed Lou as a former baseball bench warmer who never goes to hockey games.

Yikes, it’s getting hot in here, eh?

But if there was trepidation in the Garden going into the third period — and there was, mostly because of Rask — there was pure delirium when DeBrusk put the Bruins ahead.

Cassidy chose his words carefully speaking about Rask after the game, saying, “We play for one another, we have all year. You want your goalie to be at his best, that’s stating the obvious . . . I don’t think there was a doubt if we got tied or took the lead then Tuukk would be fine down the stretch.”

But it’s what happens before “down the stretch” that should concern Bruins fans.

We can all calm down for a few days. Maybe Lou Merloni and Jack Edwards can go out and have a couple of pops.

And then it’s back to work, beginning Saturday afternoon, Game 1, in Tampa."</p1>
